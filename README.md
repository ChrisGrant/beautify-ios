[Beautify](http://beautify.io/ "beautify") enhances Apple's UIKit controls, re-rendering them in order to give you much more control over their style.


##Building beautify
To build beautify, open up Beautify.xcodeproj and select the "Beautify" scheme. Hit build and the Beautify.framework target should be built and deployed to your DerivedData directory. To find the resulting framework, right click on the Beautify.framework product in the products group and select *Show in Finder*.

##Usage
###Adding the Framework
To use beautify in your own project, copy **Beautify.framework** from your *DerivedData* directory into the Frameworks group in your own project. To ensure that the framework has been linked correctly, check that Beautify.framework appears in the *Link Binary with Libraries* section of your target's build phases.

###Activating beautify
Activating beautify requires one line of code:

	[[BYBeautify instance] activate];

Place this at the top of the `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method in your app delegate and all of the controls in your app will then be rendered with beautify. You shouldn't notice an immediate change. The default states of the controls have been styled to match the default Apple style. When you do want to modify the appearance of your controls you have two options:

1.	**Building a Theme in Code**
	
	Start off by instantiating a new `BYTheme` object. This object contains all of the properties you will need to style your application. Don't worry about leaving some of the properties nil if you want to keep the default style. If beautify detects a nil property then it will revert to the default style anyway.
	
	Every style has a `defaultStyle` method for when you wish to take a default style for a control and modify it slightly. Doing this for the switch would look something like this:
	
		BYTheme *themeBuiltInCode = [BYTheme defaultTheme];
		BSwitchStyle *modifiedSwitchStyle = [BYSwitchStyle defaultStyle];
		modifiedSwitchStyle.border = [[BYBorder alloc] initWithColor:[UIColor blue] width:2.0f radius:0];
		themeBuiltInCode.switchStyle = modifiedSwitchStyle;
	
	This would give you a switch with a 2px blue border and an otherwise default appearance.
	
	Once you've built your theme with code, applying it is simple. Just place the following code underneath the activation line in your AppDelegate, which will apply the theme you have just built to all of the controls in the application:

		[[BYThemeManager instance] applyTheme:themeBuiltInCode];

2.	**Loading a Theme from a JSON File**

	It is also possible to build your theme in JSON and then pass that into the app.
	
	The structure of the JSON file should match the exact structure of a `BYTheme` object, all of it's properties and all of their properties etc. 
	
	Colors value should be defined in hex strings. 8 character hex strings can be used to support alpha values for colors.
	
	To see an example JSON file, take a look at the demoStyle.json file in the demo app bundle.
	
	Once you have constructed your own JSON file, simply replace the call to `[[BYBeautify instance] activate]` in your AppDelegate with the following line:

		[[BYBeautify instance] activateWithStyle:@"myJSONStyleFile"];

	*Note that you don't need to pass in the ".json" part of the file name - that is handled internally.*

###Styling Specific Controls
Once you have applied your theme, either through code or with a JSON file, you may find that you want to specify a different style for a subset of the controls in your app.

Let's say you have a lot of buttons in your app but want to emphasise one of them by surrounding it with a red border. All you have to do is get the renderer associated with that button, and set it's border property for whatever state(s) you want it to appear on.

	UIButton *redBorderedButton;
	
	// Set up the button as usualâ€¦
	
	BYButtonRenderer *buttonRenderer = redBorderedButton.renderer;
	BYBorder *redBorder = [[BYBorder alloc] initWithColor:[UIColor redColor] width:5.0f radius:0];
	[buttonRenderer setBorder:redBorder forState:UIControlStateNormal];

And that's it! `redBorderedButton` will now have a red, 5px border while it's state is `UIControlStateNormal`.

###Excluding Controls
Often, you will want certain controls to be excluded by beautify and for them to keep their default styling. To do this, simply set the `isImmuneToBeautify` property on any of your controls to `YES`. The default value for `isImmuneToBeautify` is `NO` for all controls, except **UIImageView**. 

UIImageViews are commonly used as the component parts of other controls and are often frequently throughout applications. Given how unlikely it would be that you would want to style every single image view in your application, we decided to default the `isImmuneToBeautify` property to `YES` for UIImageViews. If you do wish to style a UIImageView, simply set it to `NO`.
